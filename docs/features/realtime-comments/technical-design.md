## 1. Summary

Real-time comment delivery via a Cloudflare Durable Object WebSocket relay. Replaces the manual "Check comments" KV polling flow with instant comment delivery while keeping KV as the persistence and offline fallback layer.

**Scope (v1):** add + resolve only. Edit/delete deferred until KV supports per-comment mutation.

## 2. Why Not WebRTC

A previous attempt used browser-to-browser WebRTC (Trystero + Yjs, commits `061293e`–`ec90b13`). It failed because the product is used inside a corporate VPN that blocks:

1. Signaling relays — tried Nostr, BitTorrent, MQTT, back to Nostr over 3 days
2. Direct peer connections — even with STUN + free TURN servers

Analysis of [claude-duet](https://github.com/EliranG/claude-duet) showed the key insight: when P2P fails, fall back to a WebSocket relay over standard HTTPS. WSS on port 443 is much more likely to pass through VPN than WebRTC since blocking it would break most web applications.

```

**Topology:** Single relay hub DO, multiplexed by `docId`. Each client opens one WebSocket. The DO routes messages by checking per-socket subscription attachments (`serializeAttachment`/`deserializeAttachment` — survives hibernation).

**Dual-layer:** Comments are posted to KV (persistence) AND broadcast via WebSocket (delivery). KV is the primary durable catch-up layer on reconnect, supplemented by transient `resolvedCommentIds` for relay/KV reorder protection within a session.

| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Real-time relay    | Cloudflare Durable Object (WebSocket Hibernation API)            | Same platform as existing Worker; free tier sufficient; WSS passes through VPN |

| Subscription state | Socket attachments                                               | Survives DO hibernation without in-memory Maps                                 |
| Keep-alive         | Application-level ping/pong (30s)                                | Prevents VPN proxy idle timeouts                                               |

No new npm dependencies are required. The platform stack (Web Crypto, Cloudflare Worker + KV, GitHub Pages) is unchanged.

## 5. Wire Protocol

### Outbound (client → DO)

| Frame              | Fields                           | Encrypted                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `SubscribeFrame`   | `{ type: "subscribe", docId }`   | No                                                 |
| `UnsubscribeFrame` | `{ type: "unsubscribe", docId }` | No                                                 |
| `PingFrame`        | `{ type: "ping" }`               | No                                                 |
| `RelayFrame`       | `{ version: 1, docId, payload }` | `payload` is base64-encoded AES-256-GCM ciphertext |

### Inbound (DO → client)

| Frame              | Fields                              | When                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `SubscribeOkFrame` | `{ type: "subscribe:ok", docId }`   | Subscribe confirmed             |
| `ErrorFrame`       | `{ type: "error", docId, message }` | Subscribe failed / other errors |
| `PongFrame`        | `{ type: "pong" }`                  | Keep-alive response             |
| `RelayFrame`       | `{ version: 1, docId, payload }`    | Message from another client     |

### Relay message types (inside encrypted payload)

| Type               | Direction   | Purpose                           |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------- |

## 6. Key Design Decisions

| Decision                  | Choice                                    | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Yjs CRDT vs plain events  | Plain events                              | No concurrent editing — each author owns their comments; host resolves unilaterally                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Subscribe ACK             | `subscribe:ok` / `error` with retry       | KV eventual consistency can reject valid subscriptions; client must not show false-connected state                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Intentional close flag    | `closedIntentionally` boolean             | Distinguishes deliberate close (all subscriptions removed) from unexpected failure; prevents reconnect after intentional shutdown                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Zombie comment prevention | `resolvedCommentIds` set (session-scoped) | Tracks resolved IDs so late-arriving `comment:added` (from KV catch-up) is skipped after a resolve. Session-scoped only — does not survive page reload. The durable protection is the auto-push: `mergeComment` pushes updated content to KV before broadcasting `comment:resolved`, so a reloading peer gets the resolved state from KV. See §8. |
| Peer reconnect catch-up   | Fetch comments from KV + reload content   | Two-step: KV catches missed adds, content reload catches missed resolves (requires host auto-push)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Host reconnect catch-up   | Active tab only                           | `fetchAllPendingComments` is tab-scoped; background tabs catch up on switch (documented limitation)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## 7. State Changes

### New AppState fields (global, not persisted)

```typescript
rtStatus: "disconnected" | "connecting" | "connected";
rtSocket: RelayConnection | null;
rtSubscriptions: Set<string>;
documentUpdateAvailable: boolean;
remotePeerComments: PeerComment[];
resolvedCommentIds: Set<string>;
```

### Existing fields reused

- `TabState.pendingComments: Record<string, PeerComment[]>` — host receives relay comments here
- `TabState.shares: ShareRecord[]` — `pendingCommentCount` updated on live delivery
- `myPeerComments` / `submittedPeerCommentIds` — peer's own comments (not touched by relay)

---

## 8. Required Pre-Implementation Changes

These must be done before the relay feature can ship safely:

1. **Per-comment KV deletion** — Add `DELETE /comments/:docId/:cmtId` to the Worker. Change `mergeComment`/`dismissComment` to delete only the resolved comment, not all comments for the share.

2. **Durable resolve sequence** — When the host resolves a comment, three things must happen in this order before broadcasting `comment:resolved`:
   a. **Delete the comment from KV** (`DELETE /comments/:docId/:cmtId`) — prevents reconnect catch-up from reimporting a resolved comment.
   b. **Push updated content to KV** (`updateShare(docId)`) — ensures `loadSharedContent()` reflects the resolve.
   c. **Broadcast `comment:resolved`** — notifies connected peers.
   This ordering ensures that if a peer reloads at any point during the sequence, the durable KV state (both comment blobs and shared content) already reflects the resolve. The relay broadcast is the notification; KV is the durable record.

## 11. Known Limitations

- **v1 scope: add + resolve only.** Edit/delete deferred until KV supports per-comment mutation.
- **Host reconnect is active-tab-only.** Background tabs catch up on switch.
- **Single DO instance.** Fine for 2–5 peers; needs sharding if scaled.
- **Peer resolve recovery requires auto-push.** If the host hasn't pushed updated content after resolving, `loadSharedContent()` won't reflect the resolve.
- **VPN compatibility is "much more likely" not "guaranteed."** Some proxies may still interfere with WebSocket upgrades.
